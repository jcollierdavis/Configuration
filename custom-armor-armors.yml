#         Armors.yml: Here you add and customize your armors
#                     Create each armor like the EXAMPLE armor is done below. (For more help in creating armors look under 'Config Information' on the Bukkit Dev page)
#                     After creating your armor add it's name to the 'Registered_Armors' list.
#                     * For plugin settings go to 'Settings.yml'
#                     Note: Disabled features aren't deleted, they just aren't looked at by the plugin. Just ignore features that are disabled.
#                     New Features:
#                           DuraChangePerHit: The value the armor will decrease by every times it's damaged. Can be positive to increase.
#                                             Setting "DuraChangePerHit:" to "0" will not make the armor unbreakable, sadly.
#                           PotionEffects: Format it "EFFECT:LEVEL" Separate potion effects with a "," just like Enchantments. "TIME" is not an option
#                                          because of how the plugin updates/resets potion effects.
# You Must add your armor to Registered_Armors to get it in-game (Case Sensitive ~!)
